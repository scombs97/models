**Download the Pascal Training Set**

In order to make our training *much* faster we'll want to use a pre-trained model, in this case pascal VOC2012. [You can download it here](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/deeplabv3_pascal_train_aug_2018_01_04.tar.gz). Extract it into the `PQR/exp/train_on_tranval_set/init_models` directory (should be named `deeplabv3_pascal_train_aug`).
